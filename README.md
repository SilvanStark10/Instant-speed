My goal was to find a way to load a site with all the data instantly. I was annoyed that the data fetching takes so long. Therefore I searched for a way to do this and I tried many things. Right now one interesting solution is to use Go to fill in the variable values on the site so the user doesn't have to wait at all for the data to load. You can check goldpluto.com/go to see how fast it is.
