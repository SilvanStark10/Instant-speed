My goal was to find a way to load a site with all the data instantly. I was annoyed that the data fetching takes so long. Therefore I searched for a way to do this and I tried many things. Right now one interesting solution is to use Go to fill in the variable values on the site so the user doesn't have to wait at all for the data to load. You can check goldpluto.com/go to see how fast it is.

Based on this project I am taking the learnings I now know how to make any website ultra fast if I need to make it extremely fast.

Important to know: This is only for the purpose of finding out how to make a site fast, and nothing else.
